Hi there! My name is Erich. I‚Äôm a forensic photographer, father, and‚Äîunjustly, I assure you‚Äîsometimes called ‚Äòslightly crazy‚Äô (pure slander!). Above all, I‚Äôm a passionate fan of tabletop and virtual tabletop RPGs.

<br>
This is my first attempt at sharing an adventure with the community, and I sincerely hope you enjoy it!
<br> 
<br>
For those who wish to support me, I‚Äôve included a ‚Äúbuy me a coffee‚Äù link.
<br> 
<br>
Perhaps next time I can use some proper AI subscriptions instead of suffering through the free tier, LOL!!!

Thank you in advance for your generosity!https://buymeacoffee.com/jack_sands

Jack Sands is an old RPG character close to my heart, and I use his name as my online alias. I still find it hilarious when people call me Jack because they remember his name more than mine even to this day.

# **DEAD SEA**
<br> 
<br>


**Deep Down** is a variation of the amazing cinematic scenario **Dead Sea**, created by **Alex Aguila**, who most generously allowed me to publish this adaptation.

# **About Deep Down**
<br> 
<br>
After running the Colonial Marines campaign‚Äîwhich my players absolutely loved‚Äîdespite having zero prior experience with the Alien RPG, I decided to take on a cinematic scenario. I was already set on using Dead Sea, but my players were eager to face the Xenos, so I made some adjustments!
<br> 
<br>

It was a blast! I've run it several times now, receiving great feedback, so I decided to share it!Now I'm making a joke with the directions. First, DEEP DOWN, and now they're playing CRAWLING UP!‚Äîa mini-campaign on its 8 sessions and not even half way. Next will be RUNNI... oops, they don't know that yet! üòâ

<br>



# **Key Changes in Deep Down**
<br> 
<br>


The most notable change in Deep Down is the introduction of a form of xenomorph. My players specifically wanted to face the ‚Äúde facto‚Äù protagonist! But I like surprises!Another significant difference is the map, which I created using my own assets for the VTT, forcing me to accommodate for what I had.

# **MODULES**
<br>
<br> 
REQUIRED:
<br>
<br>
FX MASTER  -  The only one that can create these beautiful effects on the scene, especially underwater. The native weather in Foundry just can't achieve this!
<br>
<br> 
MONK ACTIVE TILES TRIGGER  -  Helps a lot with automations! You can live without it, but trust me, it‚Äôs a sad life.
<br>
<br> 
TAGGER  -  Needed for the MONK module to work properly.
<br>
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
SUGGESTED:
<br>
<br> 
Easy Regions  -  Enhances the text when teleporting tokens, making it much smoother.
<br>
<br> 
Journal Scaler  -  If you have vision impairments, this will help a lot.
<br>
<br> 
MONK SCENE NAVIGATION  -  Helps with scene organization, keeping things neat.
<br>
<br> 
TOKEN MAGIC FX  -  Why FX? Well... it‚Äôs pretty!
<br>
<br> 
Share Media  -  The best way to show media to your players!
<br>
<br> 
Token Variant Art  -  This takes time to configure, but helps with tokens that have multiple images, which is great for immersion.
<br>
<br> 
<br>
<br> 
A last-minute suggestion:
<br>
<br> 
Use Lock View to fix some scenes if you have the time. All intros and the rise and fall should be pre-configured, but I think the GM should also activate it in the module settings. Since I can't automate this, I leave it as a suggestion.Library: Scene PackerIf you make all this and the module breaks, or journal links break, this solves that kind of problem and brings some automation. Take a look at its README!I'm trying to remove this requirement since it is braking the music configuration for scenes.

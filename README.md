Hi there! My name is Erich. I’m a forensic photographer, father, and—unjustly, I assure you—sometimes called ‘slightly crazy’ (pure slander!). Above all, I’m a passionate fan of tabletop and virtual tabletop RPGs.

<br>
This is my first attempt at sharing an adventure with the community, and I sincerely hope you enjoy it!
<br> 
<br>
For those who wish to support me, I’ve included a “buy me a coffee” link.
<br> 
<br>
Perhaps next time I can use some proper AI subscriptions instead of suffering through the free tier, LOL!!!

<br>
Thank you in advance for your generosity!https://buymeacoffee.com/jack_sands

Jack Sands is an old RPG character close to my heart, and I use his name as my online alias. I still find it hilarious when people call me Jack because they remember his name more than mine even to this day.

# **DEAD SEA**
<br> 
<br>


**Deep Down** is a variation of the amazing cinematic scenario **Dead Sea**, created by **Alex Aguila**, who most generously allowed me to publish this adaptation.

# **About Deep Down**
<br> 
<br>


After running the Colonial Marines campaign—which my players absolutely loved—despite having zero prior experience with the Alien RPG, I decided to take on a cinematic scenario. I was already set on using Dead Sea, but my players were eager to face the Xenos, so I made some adjustments!
<br> 
<br>


It was a blast! I've run it several times now, receiving great feedback, so I decided to share it!Now I'm making a joke with the directions. First, DEEP DOWN, and now they're playing CRAWLING UP!—a mini-campaign on its 8 sessions and not even half way. Next will be RUNNI... oops, they don't know that yet! 😉
<br> 
<br>


More truly about Deep Down in the journals!

# **Key Changes in Deep Down**
<br> 
<br>


The most notable change in Deep Down is the introduction of a form of xenomorph. My players specifically wanted to face the “de facto” protagonist! But I like surprises!Another significant difference is the map, which I created using my own assets for the VTT, forcing me to accommodate for what I had.
